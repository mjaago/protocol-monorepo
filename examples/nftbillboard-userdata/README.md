# Superfluid NFT Billboard 

Learn how to insert and make use of additional metadata within your super agreements.

In this tutorial, you'll use Superfluid UserData to pay to post a message on an NFT billboard. We'll use scaffold-eth, hardhat, and react to get the job done ⛏

Note: this code has not been audited and is for example purposes only. 

We're exited to see what you build 💻

Usage

1) Go get some test DAIx tokens at app.superfluid.finance
2) Add your own private key and rpc URL for Mumbai inside of a .env file using the format in ```packages/hardhat/example.env```
3) Set Ethereum address with the test tokens to the _sender variable inside of the ```createFlow.js```, ```updateFlow.js```, and ```deleteFlow```.js scripts inside of the hardhat package
4) Add one of your Ethereum addresses as the owner within the deployment script ```00_deploy_tradeable_cashflow.js```
5) Add your own custom message inside of each of the scripts as the value that is encoded and set to the ```userData``` variable



For initial setup and contract deployment:

```yarn install```
```yarn deploy```

To run the react app
```yarn start```

To create flows and set an initial message
```npx hardhat run scripts/createFlow.js```

To update flows and change the message
```npx hardhat run scripts/updateFlow.js```

To delete flows
```npx hardhat run scripts/deleteFlow.js```

To read data and see userData logged in the console
```npx hardhat run scripts/readData.js```


NOTE: be careful with your private keys! Do not publish them to github. 



# 🏗 Scaffold-ETH

> everything you need to build on Ethereum! 🚀

🧪 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract:

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth.git
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
